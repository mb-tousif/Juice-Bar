      <p>Juice Bar was born because our founders understood that wellness didn't have to be high maintenance. Prioritizing nutrition shouldn't mean sacrificing taste. What started as a little passion project continued to grow, expanding across states and infusing the pursuit of wellness with joy. As we continue to write Juice Bar's story, we begin every day with gratitude for the people who have carried us this far with your support and love for our fresh, homemade juices, smoothies, bowls, and more. </p>
